Documentation on where the pieces of the mpd-myfm puzzle go.

To use mpd-myfm you need python version 2.5 or above (not python 3) and must
install the python mpdclient module which is available on most distributions as
a package.

If you just want to run mpd-myfm manually from your home, you can copy the
whole directory you got from git to wherever you want.
To use a config file edit "~/.mpd-myfm". If you want to use the lirc functions
you should also edit "~/.lircrc".

If you plan on using mpd-myfm as a daemon process running from init.d
you have to copy a few files.

 * Copy the daemon directory and lastfm.py file to 
   "/usr/local/lib/python[VERSION]/site-packages/mpd-myfm".
   If you already have the daemon module from PEP3143 (see 
   "http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3143/") you can suffice with only
   copying lastfm.py
 * Secondly place the mpd-myfm executable in root's $PATH.
   And make it executable (chmod +x).
 * Then make a copy of the init.d script in "/etc/init.d/" (make 
   runlevel configurations to your likings).
 * Mpd-myfm looks for a config file at /etc/mpd-myfm.conf
 * To use lirc you should also specify a lircrc file in the configuration.

This should do it. If you have any trouble getting mpd-myfm to run from the 
init.d script, try running it manually as root first. (this is due to issues with
the loading of our own modules which are probably fixed now.)

The config file uses a format of 'OPTION = VALUE' the options are:
  hostname  = The hostname or ip address of the mpd server. (127.0.0.1)
  portnr    = The port number to use in the connection. (6600)
  passwd    = If you use a password to connect to the mpd server set it here.
  reconnecttime = The time to wait before reconnecting on connection loss. (60)
  repeatfactor  = The number of tracks to check for the same artist, and reduce
                  the possibility of adding a song by the same artist. (20)
  albummode = Set this to True (capital T) to make mpd-myfm add whole albums in
              stead of just one song. (False)
  logfile   = The file to place the log messages in. (No logfile)
  daemonize = Run as daemon (ignored when started from init.d) (False)
	verbosity = Level of output, set to 1 to see which songs get added. (0)
  lastfmaccount = The username of your last.fm account to find loved songs.
  pidfile   = The process id file to use (ignored when started from init.d), to
              make sure you don't run more than one instance of mpd-myfm. (No pidfile)

The lirc configuration commands mpd-myfm accepts are:

 * 'albummode'   Toggles albummode, lets the music hiccup to let you know it 
                 received the command.
 * 'play'
 * 'stop'
 * 'pauze'
 * 'volumeup'
 * 'volumedown'
 * 'next'
 * 'prev' 
 * 'updatedb'
