This Python script implements a console client for Music Player Daemon that
adds tracks from similar artists to your playlist before you reach the end of
your playlist.

The similar artists are retrieved from the Last.fm database, which means you'll
need an active internet connection for the client to work.

Right now you'll need to edit the UPPERCASE variables at the top of the script
according to your setup before you can run the client.

This script uses the Python "mpd" module. On Ubuntu you can install this module
by executing the command "sudo apt-get install python-mpd" without the quotes.

To disable the client without killing it you can enable random and/or repeat.
The client will start working again when you disable both random and repeat.
