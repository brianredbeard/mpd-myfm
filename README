This Python script implements a console client for Music Player Daemon that
adds tracks from similar artists to your playlist before you reach the end of
your playlist.

The similar artists are retrieved from the Last.fm database, which means you'll
need an active internet connection for the client to work.

Unless you're running Music Player Daemon on your local machine you'll need to
provide the host name to the client using the -H or --host command-line option.
You can use -h or --help to show a list of available options.

This script uses the Python "mpd" module. On Ubuntu you can install this module
by executing the command "sudo apt-get install python-mpd" without the quotes.

To disable the client without killing it you can enable random and/or repeat.
The client will start working again when you disable both random and repeat.
