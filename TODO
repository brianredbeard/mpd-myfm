 * Write an init script so that the client starts automatically after MPD.
 * Select random similar artists instead of tracks, because otherwise the
   number of tracks per artist influences the randomness too much? (of course
   this assumes each artist has several tracks)
 * Use favorite tracks to fall back on when no similar tracks are found?
 * Make it less likely that songs from the same artist are placed in the
   playlist short after another.
