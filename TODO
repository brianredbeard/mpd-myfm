 * Select random similar artists instead of tracks, because otherwise the
   number of tracks per artist influences the randomness too much? (of course
   this assumes each artist has several tracks)
 * Use favorite tracks to fall back on when no similar tracks are found?
 * Cache the similar artists retrieved from Last.fm?
