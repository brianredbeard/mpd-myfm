 * Select random similar artists instead of tracks, because otherwise the
   number of tracks per artist influences the randomness too much? (of course
   this assumes each artist has several tracks)
 * Use favorite tracks to fall back on when no similar tracks are found?
 * Cache the similar artists retrieved from Last.fm?
 * When the last track doesn't have a genre, search the other tracks in the
   Media Player Daemon library by the same artist for a genre. Optionally also
   support multiple genres?
 * Add an option to make mpd-myfm not add long songs (i.e. uncut live sets or LP's), maybe disabled in album mode?
